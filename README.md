# swe573-software-development-practice

## Introduction
This repository is a part of the SWE 573 Software Development Practice course for Fall 2024 at Boğaziçi University Software Engineering master's program. It will be used to manage a software development project throughout its entire lifecycle from requirements elicitation to deployment, including requirement specification, software modeling, development, quality assurance, documentation, and version management.

## About the Project
Eureka Nexus is a web platform designed to identify unknown human-made objects through a collaborative, community-driven approach. The name of the project is selected to reflect its purpose. While “Eureka” signifies discovery, “Nexus” represents connection and collaboration. 

Eureka Nexus creates an efficient platform in order to identify objects where users can:
•	Post images of unidentified objects and provide detailed descriptions using attributes.
•	Collaborate with other users through threaded comments and voting.
•	Utilize semantic tags fetched from Wikidata for enhanced categorization and searchability.

The technological stack of the Eureka Nexus is as follows:
•	Frontend and Backend: Python with Django framework
•	Database: PostgreSQL
•	Containerization: Docker
•	Deployment: Render.com
•	Version Control: Git and Github
